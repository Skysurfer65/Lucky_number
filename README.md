## LUCKY NUMBER
This was an assignment to write an easy CLI game with **PYTHON**

# INSTRUCTIONS
Write your name and birthdata according instructions. The program should be safeguarded to
input errors.
Now the program will create a list of random numbers  from 1 - 100 and choose a lucky number.
Your goal is to find that lucky number!
After your first attempt the list will be shorten to make it easier.

# REFAKTORED
To increase playablility to shorter list has been increased and player input (if wrong)
removed already after first guess.
Also the order of the list is changed every time before being displayed.

# TESTS
Tests done with **PYTEST** which is an built in test module. To run just write pytest within
directory.
